# React + Vite

Built With:
React, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, axios,  and Rick and Morty API

This is an React Web Application using a Rick and Morty Api. With this API you are able to search for a character by name, find aired dated for episodes and locations for different demonsions.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
